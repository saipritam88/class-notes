DRY -> Don't repeat yourself

How can you call one script from another script?

1. call by sh <script-name> runs in different process, can't access script-1 environment. script-1 is not effected by script-2 failure
2. source <script-name> runs in the same proces sof script-1 can access script-1 environment. script-1 is effected by script-2 failure
