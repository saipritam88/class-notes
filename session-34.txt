1. Tfvars
2. Workspaces
3. Different repos

same code for all environments, code re use
whatever code is written it may be accidentally applied into PROD

uses
=====
clear isloation b/w environments, no accidental changes
code should be duplicated -> disadvantage

Modules development
========
if seperate code for each component, there is no single point of control

scb -> top level project
savings banking
current banking
mobile banking
whatsapp banking
demat
loans

if there is version change, we need to update in all components
there are no common standards for all the projects
maintanance and update is very tough

module advantages
=================
1. changes at single place cascade to all components using that module -> centralised approach
2. we can implement industry best standards in the module, all other components are forced to use. better for governance, compliance and auditing
3. code reuse

module developers
module users

terraform naming convention
===========================
sivakumar_reddy_m -> for programs

sivakumar-reddy-m -> for humans

human ramesh
ramesh

catalogue-instance -> resource type should not be used in resource names
id -> string
ids -> list

module "module-name" {

	source = ""
	mandatory-variables
}
