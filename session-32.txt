Remote state
==============
state is used by terraform. usually we should not touch state file. 

We should secure state file from accidental changes.

1 person completed infra, state is in his local..
2nd person want to do changes, he initialise terraform, he will plan and he will apply
1. either duplicate resources
2. error while creating resources saying that already exists

we must keep state file in remote location while working in colloboration environment for security and preventing duplicate resources and errors when multiple members are working together

state file should be locked when terraform is doing something, so that other person can't apply the changes.

locals
=======
locals are like variables but it has many extra capabilities
1. variables can be overriden, locals can't be overriden
2. you can use variables inside locals. but we can't use one variable in another variable
3. you can store expressions or functions inside locals block and reuse them whenever required
