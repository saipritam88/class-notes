include_role vs import_role

include_role
==============
it includes at run time, checks while processing. include will not respect tags. We must explicitly set inside the tasks

import_role
==============
imports the role before exection and parse it, checks before processing. applying tags at the import setup to all the tasks automatically.

dynamic inventory
===============
autoscaling, when trafic increase servers will be increased
a plugin is provided aws and ansible to fetch the IP address dynamically

query aws
us-east-1, ec2, running and name should be frontend

tasks -> execute something on the remote/target server
plugins -> connects to other system and fetch required information

*.aws_ec2.yml/yaml

ansible can connect to AWS dynamically to fetch the IP address using dynamic inventory plugin(amazon.aws.aws_ec2), this helps in autoscaling kind of environment, where fetching the IP address statically is not possible

secrets
==========
vault -> secured place to keep the secrets

ansible-vault

ansible-vault create vault.yaml

secrets manager
===============
AWS is a platform

hashicorp vault

store key inside the server
