Configuration management
=====================
Collections/Modules. It will have parameters

Ansible can create infra, but it can't manage/update infra because of no state management feature available in ansible, originally created created for configuration management not good for infra management..

Use terraform for infra creation, once servers are created by terraform handover them to ansible, ansible completes configuration in the server

Terraform -> IaaC Infrastructure as a code

CM -> Configuration as a code
CRUD
Creation of configuration
Reading the configuration
Update the configuration
Delete the configuration

Infra as a code
===============
Version control
Automatic CRUD
Consistent infra -> DEV, QA, UAT, PRE-PROD, PERF, PROD
Inventory -> What are the services we are using in cloud
Cost optimisation
Time saving and no human errors
Dependency -> SG, EC2 and then R53
Modular reusable infra

Terraform, Pulumi, Cloudformation, etc..

HCL -> Hashicorp configuration language

name, image, sg, storage disk, key(no-key)

{
	key = "value"
}

resource "aws_instance" "name-of-resource" {
	
	ami = ""
	name = ""
	storage = ""
	key = ""
	instance_type = ""

}

resource "type_of_resource" "name-of-resource" {
	
	key = value
	
}

terraform init -> downloads the provider, intialise terraform
terraform plan -> It will give us a plan that what it is going to do
terraform apply -> creates the infra as given in the plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform destroy -auto-approve
